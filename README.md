If you want to contribute to this project, I recommend you to first extract your profile system files (.proto file) by doing a *full save state* operation.
Then I highlly recommend you to save those files in a safe place.

## OS platform

This code have been developped on macOS platform.
**But**, all the function are other OS platform proof. No adaptation have to be implement by the user.
